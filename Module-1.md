# Module 1

## What is music?
An organized combination of sound and silent moments.

In a more teachable and all-embracing definition, music is created by a flowing composition of melody, harmony and rhythm.

### What is melody?
Melody is the “singable” flow of sound

### What is harmony?
The overlapping notes that serve as a base to the melody are the harmony.

### Whay is rhythm?
Rhythm is the beat of time through the music. Just as the watch marks hours, the rhythm  leads us at a certain pace through the song.

## Music Note
A music note is the minimum element of musical sound.

### Identifying a music note
In music theory within the English-speaking world, pitch classes  typically represent the notes by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet, (A, B,C,D,E,F,G). However, most other countries in the world identify the notes by the naming convention of Do-Re-Me-Fa-Sol-La-Ti (H in German for the last one).  The letter definition and corresponding notes are:

C –>do
D –>re
E –>mi
F –>fa
G –>sol
A –>la
B –> ti (H in German)

## Timbre
Timbre (tone quality, color) is what differentiates two sounds in the same frequency (same note). For example, the Do (C) note played in a guitar has a really different sound of a Do (C) when played in keyboard or flute. This means that these instruments have different timbres.

## Tone and semitone
In western music, there are 12 notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A# e B. The symbol “#” means sharp. From these 12 notes, 7 of them receive a specific name (do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, si) and the other notes are identified for a sharp (#) or flat (b) of these notes, also called accident. A sharp, by definition is the smaller distance between two notes in western music, as well as the flat. The difference in nomenclature (flat and sharp) serves only to indicate if we are referring to a note above or below. For example: Re flat is the same as Do sharp. Read the next section “tones and semitones” to complement this concept. Here below there are some representations and their equivalences, to make the understanding easier:

Re # # = Mi

Mi b b = Re

Mi # = Fa

Fa b = Mi

### What are tones and semitones
 A tone is a distance of two sharps (or two flats). A semitone is the distance of one sharp (or one flat).

## Music scales - Definition
Music scale is an organized sequence of notes. For example: C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C… repeating this cycle. This scale started with the C note and goes following a defined sequence of intervals until the return to the C note again. This sequence of distance was, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone, tone, semitone… repeating the cycle. This scale is called Major Scale.

The other scales, we have other sequences to be followed.
"Minor scale" is formed by a the following sequence: tone, semitone, tone, tone, semitone, tone, tone.

Let's create the C minor scale:

C, D, D#, F, G, G#, A#, C

Now let's check the shapes of major and minor scale
