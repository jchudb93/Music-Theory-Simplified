## C Major scale - shapes

Now that we already know the basic about what is a scale, we will show other shapes to C major scale

### C major starting with 5th string

## Degrees and music intervals

Probably you already heard about “first degree”, “second degree”, etc. And maybe this has sounded strange in the beginning. But, as we will see, this terminology is simple and can be really useful.

If we give numbers to C major scale in the following way: C (1st degree), D (2nd degree), E (3rd degree), F (4th degree), G (5th degree), A (6th degree), B (7th degree), we could say to a friend, for example: “play the 5th degree of C scale”, and he/she would know that we are talking about G note.

### Applying Music intervals
In a practical way, to know which note refers some degree it’s only to count with your fingers the notes starting from the one that was chosen as 1st degree. Below we have some examples, yet in C scale (use like exercise):

– Second degree of E: F
– Fourth degree of G: C
– Seventh degree of B: A
Observation: The first degree is also called “tonic”.

These examples were used only for teaching purposes.

## Augmented, diminished and perfect intervals

If you have read the article about degrees, you saw that we mentioned only 7 notes in western music (C, D, E, F, G, A, B). But if we wanted to use a reference for other notes too? (C#, D#, F#, G#, A#)? For this there is a more embracing definition, as we will see now:
In this case, the D note is the major 2nd. The note C# (or Db), in this case, is the minor 2nd. This nomenclature (“major” and “minor”) exists to indicate if the interval (distance between two notes) is short or long. Major intervals are long and minors are short. You can see that in the previous example, the “major second” represented the interval of one tone (because D is a tone above C), and the “minor second” represented the interval of half tone (Db is half tone above C). Therefore, these names were given just for distance identification between notes. Expanding the concept to all notes, starting with C, we have this:

C —> first degree major (perfect unison)

C# —> minor 2nd

D —> major 2nd

D#—> minor 3rd

E —> major 3rd

F —> perfect 4th

F#—> augmented 4th or diminished 5th

G —> perfect fifth

G#—> augmented fifth or minor sixth

A —> major sixth

A#—> minor seventh

B —> major seventh
